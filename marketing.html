            <h1>Where we are today</h1>
            <p> Bicycle sales exploded in 2020 due to people spending more time at home. While 2020 bicycle sales data was unavailable at the time of Tour de Four’s Market Analysis Report, personal communication revealed that this was the biggest bicycle boom in decades. Many stores were sold out of children’s bicycles and restock was difficult due to an impaired global supply chain. Based on an average market growth of 4% annually and the surge in purchases due to COVID-19, Tour de Four consulting concludes that there is unmet demand in the children’s bicycle market.  </p>
